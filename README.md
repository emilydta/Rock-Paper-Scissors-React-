# rock-paper-scissors-react

Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the Computer. First to 5 wins!

The purpose of this project was to become more comfortable coding with React.

<h2>Reflection</h2>

Before embarking on the next project in *The Odin Project* curriculum, I wanted to develop more familiarity with the basics of React, and this seemed like the perfect project idea to achieve this!  

Completing this project has taught me:
  - How to write JSX.
  - How to write and use class-based components.
  - How to manage state and props in class-based components.
  - How to deploy a React app using CRA to GitHub Pages.
